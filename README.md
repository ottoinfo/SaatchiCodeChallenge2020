# Saatchi Art Code Challenge

​
In this example, we have an art browse app partially written.
​
You can run the app with `yarn dev`. This will install and start a web server for you. You can then access it via http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
​
There are two Routes available:
​

1. [Artworks - the view you will update](http://localhost:3000/challenge/artworks)
2. [Instructions - all the tasks we would like you to complete](http://localhost:3000/challenge/instructions)
   ​

## Project Setup

​
You will start off with a basic site scaffold using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). This is the same combination of tools we use at Saatchi Art. We follow common best practices in the project structure, so it shouldn't be anything too unusual. Feel free to read the docs for these technologies if you need to refresh your knowledge.
​
The framework adds HMR (hot module reloading) for you. The only time you will should have to restart the server is if you make a change to the something in the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) application. You should not have to modify the Express `server.js` itself.
​

## File Structure

​
The suggested files you should work with are located in `apps/challenge` and `reducers.js`.
​
You may see comments at the top of files indicating whether you should avoid or edit that file. These are just suggestions. Feel free to complete the coding challenge in your preferred coding style. This includes modifying or adding files as needed.
​

## Adding a Package

​
Feel free to add any npm packages you need e.g. `yarn add dompurify`. If you add a package, you should not have to restart the dev server.
​

## End Result

​
When you are finished, we expect the app will look something like this:
